# LiveMedia-TV

# What the project does?

With this program you can now watch TV channels or radio independently.

If you find the latest TV or radio broadcast links and add them, you can easily watch live broadcasts.

You can save lists of channels and then watch them again.

Because the program can run in the background, you can do other jobs at the same time.

Unlike other sites, you will not encounter any advertising issues. (Site ads)
